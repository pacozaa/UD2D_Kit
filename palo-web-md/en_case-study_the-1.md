PALO IT Client Story

# Elevating the customer rewards experience

Digitally transforming one of Thailand's largest retail and service players

## Business challenge

The 1 was on a mission to completely transform their customer experience as part of a major digital makeover. They wanted to blend online and offline experiences seamlessly. At the same time, they were looking to streamline their development processes to speed up their time-to-market and modernize their tech stack—all without breaking the bank, thanks to cross-platform technologies.

The goal? Boost operational efficiency, keep customers happy, and stay ahead in the market.

## PALO IT solution

### ![The1 TH Business Case - 10-1](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PALO%20IT%20TH/Case%20study/The%201/The1%20TH%20Business%20Case%20-%2010-1.jpg?width=6400&height=3600&name=The1%20TH%20Business%20Case%20-%2010-1.jpg)

#### **Reduced cost**

We switched from native mobile development to cross-platform development using the Flutter tech stack. This move helped save significantly on development, maintenance, and infrastructure costs for The 1's digital solution.

#### **Reduced time-to-market**

We cut the release time from one month down to daily updates by fine-tuning the feature delivery process and fully automating testing with end-to-end implementation.

#### **Centralized user analytic tracking**

In just three months, we set up a system that tracks user analytics across iOS, Android, web, and offline platforms. This integrated approach gives The 1 a complete view of user behavior, making data-driven decisions a breeze.

![The1 TH Business Case - 9-1](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PALO%20IT%20TH/Case%20study/The%201/The1%20TH%20Business%20Case%20-%209-1.jpg?width=6400&height=3600&name=The1%20TH%20Business%20Case%20-%209-1.jpg)

#### **Upskilled the development team**

We helped their development team level up by prioritizing innovative features that enhance the O2O journey. This focus is all about driving monthly active users and delivering solid business results.

#### **Enhanced user engagement**

We introduced a variety of game mechanics to spark user interaction and ramp up transaction volumes.

## Outcomes

#### **20 million+ THB saved (US$600K)**

In just one year! We sped rewards updates from one hour to happening in real-time by transitioning to a high-availability and high-performance app, which ensures smooth operations even under heavy user loads, while reducing reliance on outdated systems.

#### **50%+ reduction in development resources**

Thanks to the Flutter tech stack, we cut down the resources needed for the development team significantly.

#### **96%+ improvement in development time**

We slashed release time from one month to daily updates by optimizing our feature delivery and automating testing through E2E implementation.

#### **300%+ improvement in click-through rate**

The CTR for the 'Quick Access Button' (QAB) soared from 0.62% (the old 'Static QAB') to 5.2% with our new 'Customer-Centric QAB', thanks to major personalization improvements in The 1 app.
