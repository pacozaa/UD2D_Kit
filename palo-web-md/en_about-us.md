About Us

# Our vision: Crafting tech as a force for good

## We do the right thing, and we do it right.

We are small enough to care locally, big enough to deliver globally. With offices across five continents, we value diverse perspectives above all else.

We care about our world

We care about our people, clients and planet. We are committed to taking concrete actions for the greater good.

We share it’s in our DNA

Knowledge is inexhaustible. We want to unleash the global creative genius. We believe in the power of collaboration and leading by influence.

We act with courage & kindness

We dare to pursue our ideas. We love critical thinking and problem-solving. We treat everyone with kindness, and stand for what is right.

We deliver awesomeness

We are the blacksmiths of our time. We aim to exceed expectations in everything we create. We are committed, responsible and business-driven.

We choose positivity

We pick a solution-driven and positive mindset. We continuously strive to improve ourselves and find meaning in what we do. We spread joy.

## Our impact journey

As innovators, we're committed to helping businesses transform to better our world. On that same token, we’re also committed to transforming ourselves. There are massive implications for ESG in the tech sector and in the industries that we serve, and it is our goal to together build products, services and business models that provide both business value and positive impact.

Below are both our accomplishments, and more importantly, the goals we’ve set for the coming years. We’re eager to adapt to change, learn from our experiences and move to meet our planet’s urgent needs.

![impact-journey](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PaloIT-Assets/images/impact-journey.png?width=569&height=381&name=impact-journey.png)

## Our goals & achievements

We are taking action to meet the following objectives and key results.

![path-forward](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/PaloIT-Assets/images/path-forward.png?width=371&height=279&name=path-forward.png)

Net-zero company

At PALO IT, reversing climate change isn’t just a priority—it’s a responsibility we share with the world. We are actively measuring our global **greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint** across all offices and taking decisive steps to reduce emissions tied to our operations. For any emissions we cannot eliminate, we are committed to offsetting them proactively. Our goal: to become a Net-Zero company by 2030.

Beyond our internal efforts, we empower our clients to embark on their own Net-Zero journeys, providing them with our Impact Tracker solution to measure and monitor both direct (Scope 1 and 2) and indirect (Scope 3) emissions.

185 projects delivered with a positive impact

We've successfully delivered a range of impactful projects, including: secondhand platforms, a Carbon Credit Stock Exchange, ESG data orchestration platforms, sustainable agriculture practices, learning management systems, and impact scoring and monitoring platforms. This is just the beginning of our journey, and we're committed to **accelerating our efforts** – what's good for people and the planet is also good for business.

100% of workforce trained on impact

Every individual across PALO IT is trained on the current state of the world, the impact of tech and how the industry has a role to play. This means **upskilling and enabling** everyone on our team to monitor impact in their roles, as well as using toolkits and methodologies to deliver projects in a responsible manner.

We seek to construct a transparent, shared understanding of what’s at stake across every arm of our organization, not just the ones that traditionally invite sustainable practices.

100% targeting B Corp certification across offices worldwide

Obtaining B Corp certification is not for the faint of heart! We use it as a framework to continuously challenge our practices and improve our ways of doing business with a purpose.

We aim for every one of our offices to be **B Corp-certified**, and will continue to improve our rating for previously-certified offices. As we continue to grow, B Corp will act as the North Star for our teams hailing from 50+ nationalities across the world.

Continuously measure and improve employee happiness

We've developed a '**Happiness** **Manifesto &** **Index'** for our teams around the world, custom-built to gauge their sentiment, and meet their expectations for happiness in the workplace. Using this tool, we strive to continuously measure and improve our team's purpose, creativity, learning curve, confidence, sense of social belonging, and joy.
