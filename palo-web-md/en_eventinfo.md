About

**Climate change, biodiversity loss**, and the urgent transition to a low-carbon economy demand bold, collaborative solutions. **As a global financial hub** and gateway to Asia, **Hong Kong** is uniquely positioned to drive innovation at the intersection of technology, finance, and sustainability. The biannual EnviroSeries conference convenes policymakers, business leaders, technologists, and environmental experts to explore actionable strategies for a resilient future. This edition focuses on Hong Kong’s multiple roles: mobilising green capital for transformative projects, pioneering green innovations across supply chain for business sustainability, and advancing smart urban infrastructure for green city development. Sessions will address critical themes such as how Hong Kong leverages its financial hub capacity to nurture green technologies, how both digital solutions and physical technologies are adopted for businesses and sustainable urban development, and how artificial intelligence and big data improve our climate risk frameworks. By bridging sectors and fostering partnerships, **the Conference aims to catalyse Hong Kong’s leadership in green finance, tech innovation, and regional climate resilience**.

Join us to shape policies, share best practices, and accelerate progress towards a net-zero future. In this Conference, we will:

* **Understand how tech, finance, and business sectors can collaborate to accelerate climate action and foster green city development;**
* **Share scalable solutions for supply chain resilience, emission mitigation and biodiversity conservation;**
* **Strengthen Hong Kong's leadership in green finance and tech-driven sustainability across Asia.**
