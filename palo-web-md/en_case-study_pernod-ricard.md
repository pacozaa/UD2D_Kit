PALO IT Client Story

# AI for everyone: unlocking Pernod Ricard's potential

One team's journey to democratize artificial intelligence and drive impactful change

## Business challenge

How can organizations leverage emerging technologies without losing sight of their most valuable asset: their people? This was the fundamental question for Pernod Ricard Mexico.

The company aimed to train nearly **400 employees**, including leaders, decision-makers, and operational staff with no previous technical background. The goal was to help them understand, apply, and harness the benefits of artificial intelligence in their daily tasks.

Pernod Ricard aimed to make AI an accessible and practical tool for everyone, seeking to uncover real opportunities for impact throughout the organization. This included improving strategic planning, streamlining operational execution, and optimizing everyday processes.

## PALO IT solution

PALO IT developed and implemented an **AI Academy** program tailored for employees across various roles and departments within the organization. More than just a training program, it provided a platform for analysis, reflection, and action—focused on uncovering opportunities for improvement, transforming organizational culture, and making the use of AI tools commonplace.

This initiative blended **technological adoption** with the cultivation of **critical thinking skills**. Participants not only learned how to utilize AI but also gained the ability to assess its impact, implement it thoughtfully, and lead its adoption in a conscious and sustainable manner.

What made this initiative stand out from the crowd?

* **Accessible AI Training:** Designed for non-technical staff, covering everything from fundamental concepts to real-world case studies.
* **Dynamic Workshops:** Using tools like ChatGPT, these sessions were directly applicable to participants' everyday work environments.
* **Pilot Projects:** Participants drove projects with a measurable impact, giving them the drive take ownership of their AI initiatives.
* **Effective Prompt Generation:** Training focused on creating prompts to automate tasks, analyze data, and simplify processes.
* **Cross-Functional Opportunities:** Exploration of specific AI applications across more than 11 functional areas, including finance, marketing, operations, HR, and planning.

The program was built around three essential pillars:

1. **AI Fundamentals:** Basic concepts were introduced in a clear and approachable way, stripping away technical jargon while ensuring a solid understanding of the underlying principles. AI should be for all, not just techies!
2. **Practical Application Workshops:** Participants honed their prompt engineering skills to meet their specific needs. These workshops encouraged safe experimentation and helped build confidence.
3. **Real Implementation Projects:** Each department at Pernod Ricard identified concrete opportunities for AI solutions, resulting in a portfolio of projects with tangible business benefits.

![Pernod Ricard AI workshop 2](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Pernod%20Ricard%20AI%20workshop%202.jpeg?width=800&height=450&name=Pernod%20Ricard%20AI%20workshop%202.jpeg)

## Outcomes

The results showcased how democratizing AI can produce a real impact in a remarkably short period of time:

* **266 employees** trained across various business units.
* **600+ specialized prompts** developed for specific applications.
* **240+ implementation opportunities** identified and prioritized.

Beyond the numbers, the program also led to qualitative transformations across several dimensions of the business. Projects were identified and initiated that had a direct effect on:

* Saving time on routine tasks and report generation.
* Enhancing operational and administrative processes.
* Improving the quality of information analysis and decision-making.
* Sparking innovation in creative processes and idea generation.

Participants themselves highlighted four key areas of value:

1. **Deep Yet Accessible Understanding:** They valued learning about AI without the intimidation often associated with emerging tech.
2. **Practical Prompt Engineering Skills:** Participants gained the ability to generate precise results from generative AI tools.
3. **Transformative Efficiency:** They experienced real-world improvements in their daily workflows, leading to significant time savings.
4. **Expanded Creative Horizons:** Many discovered unexpected applications that enriched their skills.

![Pernod Ricard AI workshop 4](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Pernod%20Ricard%20AI%20workshop%204.png?width=800&height=450&name=Pernod%20Ricard%20AI%20workshop%204.png)

The moral of the story? AI is not solely for specialists. When knowledge is made accessible and supported by a strategic approach, AI becomes a powerful asset for the entire organization. This marks the beginning of a new organizational culture where advanced technology and human talent work hand-in-hand to ensure sustained success.

*"Thanks to the PALO IT team and its AI Academy program, we were able to fully leverage our GPT tool, transforming the operational efficiency of all our areas. Every collaborator, regardless of their role, discovered practical and scalable ways to integrate artificial intelligence into their daily tasks, enhancing our productivity and competitiveness."*
– **Nicolas PAYET**, CEO, Pernod Ricard, Mexico & North LATAM
