# Boost your software development speed with GitHub Copilot

###

###

## Our Approach

GitHub Copilot accelerates code creation, slashes development time, improves quality and security and boosts collaboration.

Based on our experience using and deploying GitHub Copilot for the past 12 months both internally and with clients, PALO IT has developed a catalyst framework to maximize the ROI of the platform.

Whether it's for a pilot project (that we help you identify) or for full-scale deployment, our framework guarantees the best possible outcome, and as a **GitHub Partner of the Year**, we’re here to help you unlock the full potential of AI in your development process.

#### **1. Becoming an AI-Enabled Developer**

PALO IT offers practical training sessions, including a short learning lunch, to empower teams with this technology. As a development company, we prioritize real-world experience.

#### **2. AI Superpower for All Teams**

With Everything-As-Code, all teams have transformed into developers, including Testing, DevOps, Security, Cloud, and SRE. They leverage the power of GitHub Copilot and Generative AI through dedicated learning sessions.

#### **3. Swimming in the Deep End**

After completing the initial training, you may wish to delve deeper. We offer additional prompt engineering trainings or personalized coaching sessions for your teams. Let’s arrange a deep dive session to enhance their skills!

#### **4. Proof of Value**

We’ve created tools to collect data to track productivity before and after using GitHub Copilot. This allows you to assess adoption, quality, speed, and the benefits resulting from the change. With this information, you can quickly evaluate the ROI that GitHub Copilot (and other GitHub services) brings to the table.

#### **5. Guidance and Coaching**

Following the trainings, we maintain communication with your development teams through their preferred channels: e-mail, Slack, Teams, or any other means. We’re here to address their questions, and ensure continuous adoption, collect feedback, and assist with their new sidekick!
We want to make sure that GitHub Copilot stays an integral part of your workflow and helps you get all the tremendous benefits it can offer.

### Beyond GitHub Copilot: Advanced Security, Migrations & AI Delivery

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool, but it’s not the end of the GitHub value proposition.

### GitHub Advanced Security

We’ve successfully implemented GitHub Advanced Security with teams. Our view is that if making secure code is easy and straightforward, every developer will want to do it.

### ![migration](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/chub_backup/migration.png?width=200&height=133&name=migration.png)

### GitHub Migrations

Enhance your development process with GitHub Copilot. Our guided adoption journey helps teams leverage AI-powered suggestions, improving productivity and code quality. From initial PoC to in-depth training, we ensure a seamless integration that maximizes the benefits of GitHub Copilot.

### ![Gen-e2 logo 1](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Gen-e2%20logo%201.png?width=200&height=148&name=Gen-e2%20logo%201.png)Gen-e2

Further streamline your development process with our [Gen-e2 (Generative AI Enhanced Engineering)](/en/blog/gen-e2) methodology.
