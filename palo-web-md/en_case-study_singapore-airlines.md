PALO IT Client Story

# Accelerating adoption of generative AI driven digital product development

Working with Singapore Airlines to deploy a cutting-edge AI software engineering methodology

## Business challenge

PALO IT collaborated with Singapore Airlines (SIA) to deploy a cutting-edge, **AI software engineering methodology** for one of SIA’s digital product squads.

Through this collaboration, Generative AI’s transformative capability in digital product development was tested by this squad, and the positive results from this initial Proof of Concept (PoC) has led to a plan to further test and scale this innovation to wider IT teams in SIA.

## PALO IT solution

The PoC was centered on PALO IT's [Gen-e2™ (Generative AI Enhanced Engineering)](/en/blog/gen-e2) methodology, an approach that represents a paradigm shift in enterprise software development and reimagines the entire development life cycle as AI-first rather than AI-augmented.

This approach integrates GitHub Copilot deeply across every phase of a project to empower developers with an AI peer programmer, transforming the linear Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) into a more streamlined **Product Development Life Cycle (PDLC)**.

## Outcomes

* During the PoC, GitHub Copilot played a pivotal role in generating a significant proportion of the code. This contribution enabled the SIA digital product squad to successfully develop a website feature that was ready for user acceptance test in a much shorter time frame than initially planned.

  In addition to this accelerated pace, the squad also benefitted from a notable increase in **code coverage** and **higher build success rate** at earlier stage of the development, all made possible through the automation powered by Generative AI.

  *Burn Up Chart of the PoC Project: 5-week feature development using Gen-e2 versus forecasted 9-week effort with traditional methods.

  ![SIngapore Airlines Timeline](https://www.palo-it.com/hs-fs/hubfs/SIngapore%20Airlines%20Timeline.png?width=820&height=551&name=SIngapore%20Airlines%20Timeline.png)*
  *Build Success Rate jumped drastically to above 90% 3 weeks into the PoC, rate of increase is higher than that of traditional methods.*
* Results from the weekly survey have shown that the team's sentiment towards the new approach is positive and is effective in improving the team's software engineering practices.

  These results demonstrate significant **productivity gains** while also highlighting the ease of adoption of the Gen-e2 methodology, which is powered by [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot).
* This successful PoC with SIA is the result of a strong **two-year partnership** between PALO IT and GitHub to leverage Copilot’s capabilities to take software engineering to the next level by unleashing the full potential of AI in software engineering.

*“Strategic partnerships are key as we extend the reach of GitHub’s Copilot-powered platform. We’re excited to deepen our partnership with PALO IT and enable more companies to unlock innovation at scale through AI-driven software development, just as we’ve seen with Singapore Airlines."*

– **Sharryn NAPIER**, VP, APAC at GitHub
