This is a Python project with multiple modules that help and assists in generating dataset
Using `pyproject.toml` to manage dependencies.
This project is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features.
Main coding principle here is a functional programming

## Execution Guide:

- Always write plan before writing code.
- Always ask at least 2 questions before writing code.
- Always ask user for help:
  - If you are not sure about something
  - If you need to actions to be done include but not limited to:
    - Create, edit, delete file/directory
    - Run command or script
    - Include/Add more contexts or file or code
    - etc.
- Consider to ask for user feedback from time to time.

## Here is the coding rules:

- One function per file for modularity and reusability(ask for help if you need new file create)
- Use type hints
- Use docstrings
- Dependencies usage:
  - Use `pydantic` for class and data validation
  - Use `pandas` for data manipulation
  - Use `matplotlib` for data visualization
  - Use `argparse` for command line argument parsing and better developer/user experience
